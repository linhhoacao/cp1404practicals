Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I've started focusing more on planning and structuring my code before diving into the implementation.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to improve my time management and be more consistent in working on the subject material.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I’ve been staying on top of my weekly practice exercises, which has really helped reinforce the concepts from lectures. 

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop relying on online guides or examples to guide my code too heavily.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I’d suggest adding more structured group projects. 
Working with others on larger projects would help us learn to manage code collaboratively 
and see different approaches to problem-solving.
