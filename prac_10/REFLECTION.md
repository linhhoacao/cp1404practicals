# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My estimate accuracy was inconsistent at first. Sometimes I underestimated the time required for more complex tasks, 
especially when encountering unfamiliar concepts.


### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Over time, my estimates became more accurate as I gained a better understanding of the complexity of tasks and accounted
for debugging and testing. I started factoring in time for learning and troubleshooting.


### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned the importance of breaking tasks into smaller components before estimating. This approach helped me understand
the work involved and improved my ability to plan effectively.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Being reviewed taught me to appreciate different coding styles and perspectives. It also highlighted areas where I could
improve, such as naming conventions, readability, and documentation.


### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Reviewing others' code helped me recognize common mistakes and best practices. It reinforced my understanding of coding
standards and the importance of clear, maintainable code.


Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would add more real-world examples to the practicals, showing how these coding techniques are applied in industry. 
This would provide more context and motivation for the tasks.
